# 1. Potato Disease Classification
This is deep learning project in agriculture domain. Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. we will use image classification using CNN and can built a mobile app using which a farmer can take a picture and app will tell you if the plant has a disease or not.

Technology stack for this project will be :
Model Building: tensorflow, CNN, tf dataset


Setup for Python

Install Tensorflow Serving 

Training the Model :
1.Download the data from kaggle.
2.Only keep folders related to Potatoes.
3.Run Jupyter Notebook in Browser.
4.Open training/potato-disease-training.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
5.In cell #2, update the path to dataset.
6.Run all the Cells one by one.
7.Copy the model generated and save it with the version number in the models folder.
